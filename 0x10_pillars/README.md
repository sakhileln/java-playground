# Summary in Simple Terms

| Concept        | Real-Life Example       | Java Example |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Composition** | Car **HAS-A** Engine | One class **contains** another |
| **Abstraction** | TV remote (hides complexity) | Hide details, show important parts |
| **Encapsulation** | School locker (data protection) | Private variables + getters/setters |
| **Polymorphism** | One phone, many functions | Same method, different behavior |
| **Inheritance** | Baby **IS-A** human | Child class inherits from parent |


## Final Thoughts
#### Think of Java like a superhero team:
- Encapsulation keeps their secrets safe.
- Abstraction makes their powers easy to use.
- Inheritance lets new heroes learn from older ones.
- Polymorphism allows them to change forms as needed.
- Composition helps them team up for greater power.
