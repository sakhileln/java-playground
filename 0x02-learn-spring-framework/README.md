# Learn Spring
The Spring Framework is an open-source framework designed for building enterprise Java applications. It simplifies the development process by providing a collection of technologies, including Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Dependency Injection (DI), and support for Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).

## Core Features:
    - **Inversion of Control (IoC) Container**: Manages the lifecycle and configuration of application objects, enhancing modularity and testability.
    - **Dependency Injection**: Promotes loose coupling by allowing dependencies to be injected rather than hard-coded.

#### **Lightweight and Modular**: Spring is lightweight, with a basic version around 2MB, and consists of several modules such as Spring MVC, Spring ORM, and Spring Web Flow. This modularity allows developers to use only what they need.
#### **Enterprise Application Development**: It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, enabling developers to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code.
#### **Community and Evolution**: Since its initial release in 2003, Spring has evolved significantly, with a large community contributing to its continuous improvement. The framework now supports Java 17+ and various application scenarios.
